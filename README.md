# LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING
This unit focus on understand how programming languages and Unix systems work, “what is going on under the hood”. This will allow me to optimize and debug anything later. I worked with algorithms and data structures which are essential foundations for any great Software Engineer.

### C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
-Compilation
-Commenting code and following a coding style standard
-Variables, types, operators, expressions
-Loops, nested loops
-Conditional statements
-Functions
-Preprocessor, macros, header files 
-Pointers, pointers to pointers, pointers to functions, pointer arithmetic
-Arrays, multidimensional arrays 
-Structures
-Static and dynamic libraries
-Program arguments
-Dynamic allocation
-Virtual Memory, heap and stack
-Binary operations
-Makefiles

### GRAPHIC PROGRAMMING
-SDL2
-Isometric projection Raycasting

### UNIX PROGRAMMING
-Unix / Linux overview
-File I/O, Memory allocation process creation and termination System calls

### DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHMS
-Time and space complexity
-Arrays, structures
-Linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists
-Stacks and queues
-Hash tables
-Recursion
-Search & sorting algorithms
-Binary trees, BST, AVL

### PROJECTS
-Create your own printf function
-Code from scratch a mini-shell
